## Introduction

In this lab we will leverage some of the meta parameters that you can use within HCL.  Some of the richer configuration examples that you see will make extensive use of meta parameters.

## End of Lab 4

We have reached the end of the lab. You have made use of copy and copyIndex and also been introduced to a few other meta parameters.

Your .tf files should look similar to those in <https://github.com/richeney/terraform-lab4>.

In the next lab we will look at modules.
