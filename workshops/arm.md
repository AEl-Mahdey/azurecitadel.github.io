**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Introduction
 
This self-paced enablement session will run through a sequence of bite-sized labs that build on each other, introducing new elements to build up a complex templated solution that may be deployed to Azure.  

Each lab will always include links to the JSON templates at the start and end so that you may compare your own files and highlight any differences.

It is up to you how far through the labs you need to go.  The labs go through to a level of detail and complexity and leverage a number of the features within Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates that are required for certain enterprise Infrastructure as Code deployments. 

However the advice would always be to keep it as simple as possible and maximise supportability.  Therefore the recommendation is to stop at the earliest point where you can meet the business requirements.  

The comments section has been enabled and feedback is always welcome.
