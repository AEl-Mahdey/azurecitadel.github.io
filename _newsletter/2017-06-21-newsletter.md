**Azure Roadmap Site
 

One thing we in the Solution Architects team at Microsoft get asked for a lot is the Azure Roadmap. Communicating roadmaps to partners and customers when working for a software vendor can usually be tricky, very often you are presenting material which is often subject to change and usually comes with a lot of disclaimers. One of the great things about Microsoft Azure is that you as the end user have good insight into what services are going to be coming down the road into General Availability by seeing what is currently in Public Preview via the preview portal (https://preview.portal.azure.com). To build on this we now have the Azure Roadmap site which you can go to and view the current state of new features in the Azure Platform. If you are looking stay informed about new services in Azure so that you can keep your customers up to date on the platform
