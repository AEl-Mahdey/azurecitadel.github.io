## Azure Roadmap Site
 

One thing we in the Solution Architects team at Microsoft get asked for a lot is the Azure Roadmap. Communicating roadmaps to partners and customers when working for a software vendor can usually be tricky, very often you are presenting material which is often subject to change and usually comes with a lot of disclaimers. One of the great things about Microsoft Azure is that you as the end user have good insight into what services are going to be coming down the road into General Availability by seeing what is currently in Public Preview via the preview portal <https://preview.portal.azure.com>. To build on this we now have the Azure Roadmap site which you can go to and view the current state of new features in the Azure Platform. If you are looking stay informed about new services in Azure so that you can keep your customers up to date on the platform

## Azure Cloud Shell
 
 
 One feature thatâ€™s been in private preview for a while is the Azure Cloud Shell which has recently gone into Public Preview. This is a really nice little tool which allows you to run a terminal session with Azure CLI installed directly in the Azure web portal. Essentially this tool is run in a Docker container for the duration of the session. This is great if you want quick access to the platform agnostic CLI tool to run commands against your Azure tenant. When you fire up the CLI you are automatically logged in with your web session credentials. Please follow the below link to take a look at the tool and view instructions on how to use it.
