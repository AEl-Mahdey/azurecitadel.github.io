# Introduction

The Azure 101 session is intended as an introductory training for technical learners who have had little to no experience with Azure public cloud. The aim is to familiarise the student with some of the most commonly used IaaS and PaaS services in Azure, and the portal and CLI interfaces available to drive them. In terms of orientation, the trainer may use slides to help give an overview of some of the other services available within Azure, and the training will also make the student aware of some of the documentation and training resources available to them as they continue to explore.
