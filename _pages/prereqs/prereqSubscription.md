All of the workshops require a working Azure subscription.  Ensure that you have one of the following options enabled and verified:
* Visual Studio Subscription
* Internal User Rights
* Free Trial

## Visual Studio Subscription

The Visual Studio Enterprise subscription is the replacement for MSDN subscriptions, and should only be used for test/dev scenarios.  A Microsoft partner with the Cloud Platform competency receives a number of Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise with MSDN subscriptions:

**Cloud Platform Competency** | **Visual Studio Subscriptions**
Silver | 10
Gold | 35

The Global Administrator for the [Partner Membership Center](https://partners.microsoft.com/) can assign the subscription under Requirements & Assets -> Assign Privileges, as per the competency partner section of the [support page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4013871/microsoft-partner-network-mpn-visual-studio-subscriptions?tpqid=800-000036). 

Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers are entitled to $150 of Azure credits per month.  
To activate the benefit:
* Go to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits)
* Click on Activate on the Azure tile
* Follow the sign up wizard

No credit card is required for the activation.  Your subscription will be disabled if you exceed the $150/mth limit, although it will be re-enabled the following month if usage is reduced.


## Internal Usage Rights

Microsoft Cloud Platform partners are also entitled to [internal usage rights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/mpn-benefits/) Azure credits.  

**Cloud Platform Competency** | **Internal Usage Rights**
Silver |$6,100
Gold | $12,100

The internal usage rights ([IUR](http://aka.ms/iur)) credits may be used for 
* internal business use
* customer demo
* internal development and testing
* internal training for employees and customers 

The internal usage rights may be activated at [http://aka.ms/ActivateIUR](http://aka.ms/ActivateIUR).  

## Free Azure Trial Account

An Azure trial account may be created.  The trial account provides $200 of free credit, and may be used to try out any of the Azure services for 30 days.  

Visit [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free) to set up the account. 

Credit card details need to be provided for identity verification, but the spending limit is set to $0 to ensure that it remains free.  The spending limit may be changed if the account is going to be used ongoing.  

## Verification 

Once the account is enabled, prove that it is working correctly by logging into the portal at [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com).
