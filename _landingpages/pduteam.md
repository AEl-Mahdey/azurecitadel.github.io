Welcome to the Azure Practice Development Unit (PDU) - our remit is to grow partner capacity & capabilities in the UK channel ecosystem to drive Azure consumption. We are aligned by 4 key workload areas (Cloud & Infrastructure Management, Cloud Application Development, Data Platform & Analytics and Enterprise Mobility & Security), with the intention of increasing partner skills in order to drive and scale Azure opportunities.

As part of your engagement with the PDU, a Cloud Solution Architect (CSA) will be assigned to work with you. What can you expect from your CSA? We will typically work with you in the following areas:

* Provide & deliver tailored enablement workshops to ensure your teams have all the Azure skills they need.

* Evaluate your teamâ€™s skill levels, and advise on training resources & help fill knowledge gaps with coaching or mentoring.

* Advise on Azure certifications and exams.

* Provide updates on the rapidly evolving Azure platform; such as new services, preview features, etc.

* Validating solutions & architectures against customer requirements & technical capabilities.

* Provide additional technical depth / breadth to support you on opportunities.

* Assist your sales teams on customer engagements in a technical pre-sales capacity.

* Assistance with demos, hackathons, proof of concept implementations, etc. to accelerate delivery.

* Advice on partner technical benefits, support arrangements etc.
