The Modern Microsoft Partner Series

Our main goal within the Practice Development Unit is to make you as successful with the Azure platform as possible. To do this we have various initiatives focused around sales and marketing enablement and technical enablement and assistance. However we must not overlook the broader overall partner transformation process required to be successful in the public cloud market. With this in mind, Microsoft and research firm IDC (www.idc.com) have created a series of ebooks focused on the transformation process partners should consider when they are looking to transform their business into a cloud first partner. Please see the links below to download the ebooks.

GDPR is coming

Many of you will be facing questions from your customers around how they can prepare for GDPR which will come into effect in May 2018. The General Data Protection Regulation is an updated data protection regulation which is applicable to any business or organisation which holds data referencing anyone within the European Union. With heavy penalties for those who infringe on any of the rules laid out in the GDPR, every business which operates in Europe needs to be up to speed on what the new regulations mean and how they can prepare for compliance.

With this in mind, Microsoft has created a lot of content around how our customers and partners can work with Microsoft solutions to ensure compliance. Please follow the below link to go to the Microsoft portal for all things GDPR in relation to Microsoft, detailing what GDPR is, and how Microsoft can help you be compliant with this new regulation

To help you further with GDPR, Microsoft will also be hosting the following webinar on the 18th May to assist our partners with having discussions with their customers around GDPR. I encourage you to join this webinar if you are unfamiliar with GDPR, and if you are already familiar with GDPR, but want to learn more about what Microsoft is doing to help businesses with compliance.

Azure ARM Template Snippets

We know many of you are looking to automate your infrastructure deployments into Azure and that many of you have been utilizing Azure Resource Manager templates and the concept of Infrastructure as Code to ensure you can quickly deploy your cloud based environments as quickly and consistently as possible. Many of you will have used Visual Studio and the Azure SDK to do this, some will use the cross platform Visual Studio Code text editor with the ARM template authoring extensions to do this efficiently. However if you want to know the anatomy of how the JSON which makes up the various resource types is structured utilising the latest API versions. You may want to check out the following link and search for the various resource types, Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, Storage etc etc and understand what is required to stand up the resources you are looking to automate
