Introduction
============
test
This Azure 101 session is intended as an introductory training for
technical learners who have had little to no experience with Azure
public cloud.

The aim is to familiarise the student with some of the most commonly
used IaaS and PaaS services in Azure, and the portal and CLI interfaces
available to drive them.

In terms of orientation, the trainer may use slides to help give an
overview of some of the other services available within Azure, and the
training will also make the student aware of some of the documentation
and training resources available to them as they continue to explore.



Prerequisites
==============

Overview
--------

All students must complete the required prerequisites for the training
prior to attendance, to maximise the time and value of the session
itself.

There is a companion document, **Azure Student Prereqs Guide**, that
provides additional guidance to meet the pre-requisites.

Requirements
------------

-   An active Microsoft Azure subscription

-   Azure CLI 2.0. Either:

    -   Cloud Shell within the Azure Portal (no installation required)

    -   Windows 10 Linux Subsystem (lxss) with Azure CLI 2.0 installed
        (power users)

-   Basic Git tools

    -   Add Git to lxss if installed (power users)

    -   If not, then install Git Bash

Recommended
-----------

-   A Twitter account

Optional
--------

-   JSON template editor. **One** of the following:

    -   Visual Studio Code (preferred)

    -   Visual Studio 2017

Accessing and customising the portal
====================================

Azure Resource Manager Portal
-----------------------------

The main Azure portal is <https://portal.azure.com>.

Login using the account for your Azure subscription. Your account
information is at the top right, including password change, and viewing
permissions and your bill.

Next to that is the Help + Support, for accessing the help or opening up
a support ticket. Click on the Help + Support icon and then:

-   launch the guided tour

-   see what’s new

-   check the keyboard shortcuts

Clicking on the cog icon shows the Portal Settings. You can filter
multiple subscriptions, change the language and certain portal
characteristics.

-   Change the theme

Next to the Azure Cloud Shell is the _Notifications_ section, for status
updates, billing updates and to show deployment activity.

Dashboard Customisation
-----------------------

The Azure portal enables you to have multiple dashboards and to
customise those dashboards. You can also share dashboards with other AAD
users or groups within the subscription, leveraging the role based
access control (RBAC) to control who has access.

-   Create a new dashboard, and name it "Azure 101".

-   From the Tile Gallery’s General area, pull across the following items:

    -   All Resources Reconfigure (using the ellipsis (…)) to change to
        4x4 tiles

    -   Clock Reconfigure to 2x1, 24 hour, and London time

    -   Quickstart Tutorials

    -   Markdown change title to "Azure 101", subtitle to Useful Links,
        and replace the content with the markdown shown below and then resize
        to fit.

Create a resource group called Azure101IaaS
===========================================

-   Open the Azure [portal](http://portal.azure.com)

-   Choose one of the following options:

    -   Click on the + New icon (or G+N), search for _Resource Group_
        and click on it.

    -   Click on _Resource Groups_ in your favourites and click on **Add**

    -   Click on the _More Services_ icon, _Resource Groups_ in the
        General section and then on **Add**

-   Create the resource group using the following values:

    -   Resource Group Name: _Azure101IaaS_

    -   Resource Group Location: _West Europe_

-   Note the deployment notification area

-   Refresh the resource groups and click on the _Azure101IaaS_ resource
    group

Create a Virtual Network (VNet) with two subnets
================================================

-   Add a Virtual Network:

    -   Click on the **+**

    -   Search on _Virtual Network_

    -   Select, then Create

-   **Name:** _azure101vNet_

-   **Address space:** _10.4.0.0/16_

-   **Subnet name:** _webSubnet_

-   **Subnet address range:** _10.4.1.0/24_

Once created, click into the VNet and add the second subnet:

-   Select subnets on the blade

-   Add _dbSubnet_ (10.4.2.0/24)

Search on information in the portal and on the Azure docs area for:

-   Network Security Groups (NSGs)

-   GatewaySubnet

-   ExpressRoute and Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN Gateways

-   Network Virtual Appliances

-   User Defined Routes (UDRs) in Route Tables

-   vNet Peering

-   Region to region S2S VPNs

Create a Windows Virtual Machine
=======================

Go to the Azure Docs area, and click on _Windows Virtual Machines_ in the
Deploy Infrastructure section of the Get Started tab. Choose a five
minute quickstart - either portal, PowerShell or CLI (this section describes the portal method).

Create the VM
-------------

Add a Windows Server 2016 Datacenter server with the following parameters:

-   **Name:** _myWindowsVM_

-   **VM disk type:** _SSD_

-   **Resource Group:** Existing _Azure101IaaS_ resource group

-   **Location:** _West Europe_

-   **Size:** _DS1\_v2_

-   **Use Managed Disks:** _Yes_

![](https://ukpducim.github.io/images/Az101-CreateVM.JPG)

Research the following:

-   Azure Hybrid Use Benefit

-   Benefits of Managed Disks vs manual storage accounts

Add a Web Server to the VM
--------------------------

-   Add IIS via a terminal services session

-   Open port 80/tcp inbound on the NSG

-   Test access via a browser

-   Stop the VM to deallocate resource

Research the following:

-   Additional VM tutorials available - disks, DSC, images, scale sets,
    load balancing, backup, monitoring, policies, etc.

-   Deallocation vs shutdown in the remote desktop console

Create a Linux virtual machine
=====================

Create your SSH keypair
-----------------------

Run the following commands in your Bash shell:

```
cd ~
umask 033
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "richard.cheney@microsoft.com"
ls -Al .ssh
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

The -C is a comment. It is good etiquette to add in your email address
so that any key owners are easily identified. You will be prompted for a
filename. You can specify an alternative name, or hit enter to use the
defaults (recommended). For the passphrase, it is best practice to
provide a passphrase with a few memorable but disassociated words.
However, for the sake of this exercise you may simply press enter for an
empty passphrase, and then you won’t be challenged for it later when
using ssh to connect toi the Linux VM.

Copy the contents of the id\_rsa.pub file to the clipboard as you will
use this later.

Create a VM template
--------------------

Do the following from the portal

-   Add an Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS server

-   **Name:** _myLinuxVM_

-   **VM disk type:** _HDD_

-   **SSH Public Key:** Copy and pasted from cat \~/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub

-   **Resource Group:** Existing _Azure101IaaS_ resource group

-   **Location:** _West Europe_

-   **Size:** _D1\_v2_

-   **Subnet:** _dbSubnet_

-   **Availability Set:** Create _myLinuxAS_

*Do not* click on Create straight away. Let’s explore templates a
little.

-   Click instead on _Download template and parameters_. Browse the
    template JSON, the parameters JSON, and the scripts to deploy the
    template from PowerShell and CLI 2.0.

    ![](https://ukpducim.github.io/images/Az101-ARMTemplate.JPG)

-   Click on Create to submit the job.

-   Browse to the Services tab on Azure Docs, and then find the Azure
    Resource Manager tile in the Monitoring + Management area. Discover
    the [export
    template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-export-template)
    functionality, as well as the JSON [template
    structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates).

-   Click on Add within the Azure101IaaS Resource Group, and find
    _Template Deployment_.

-   In the _Load a GitHub Quickstart_ template, type “load” and
    select one of the community templates and accompanying parameters
    file.

-   Search the [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates) GitHub repo to find the same
    template.

Use the Bash shell to open a secure shell session

-   SSH to the VM’s public IP address: ssh &lt;adminuser&gt;@&lt;public
    IP address&gt;

Web Apps
========

Overview
--------

The PaaS section of the lab will touch on both Web Apps and Logic Apps. The Web App lab is split into two options - the first option is for students who are familiar with Git and uses this method to push files to the Web App, while the second option is aimed at students who are less familiar with Git tools and therefore uses FTP to upload files to the Web App.

Option 1: Using Git to push files to Web App
--------------------------------------------

The diagram below gives an overview of what we are doing with a set of html
files hosted on GitHub and pushing those into a Web App in Azure using Git.

![](https://ukpducim.github.io/images/Az101-WebApp-Git.jpg)

1.	Use git clone to download the sample static HTML site from GitHub to your laptop
2.	Login to Azure and create a deployment user
3.	Create the Azure101PaaS resource group
4.	Create the free tier app service plan
5.	Create a web app within the app service plan
6.	Configure a Git access point for the web app
7.	Define the access point as an upstream git repo called “azure”, and use git push to add the html files

### Detailed Instructions

For the Git commands, most users will use the Git Bash application.  However, those with the Linux subsystem installed on Windows 10 can run the git commands from there. For the Azure CLI 2.0 commands, students can use either the Azure Cloud Shell (>_) shown at the top of the Azure Portal, or the Linux subsystem for Windows 10 with the AZ CLI 2.0 installed.

**1. Clone the HTML files from Github to your local machine:**

* Open Git Bash and run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/richeney/azure101-webapp-html
cd azure101-webapp-html
git init
ls -Al
pwd
```

* The above commands copy the HTML files locally, change to that directory, initialise it for Git, and then finally lists the files.  The pwd command prints the working directory so that you know where they are.

* Double click the _index.html_ file in File Explorer to view the website locally.  You should see a couple of pieces of static images and text on the left, and a Twitter timeline on the right.

**2. Log in to Azure using the CLI 2.0 and create the deployment user:**

```
az login
az webapp deployment user set --user-name <id> --password <pwd>
```

* You will be prompted to make your username or password more unique if you have chosen one that is too common.
* The deployment user is the equivalent of a service account so that Git can authenticate to Azure and deploy to it.

**3. Create the resource group:**

* Within CLI 2.0 create the resource group

```
az group create --name Azure101PaaS --location westeurope
```

**4. Create the app service plan:**

App Service plans provide the dedicated resource for your apps, and multiple apps can use them. The plans define the region, available instance sizes, scale count and SKU level, i.e. free, shared, basic, standard, premium.

* Create an App Service plan called quickStartPlan on the Free SKU

```
az appservice plan create --name quickStartPlan --resource-group Azure101PaaS --sku FREE
```
You should see output JSON when the above command succeeds

**5. Create the Web App:**

* The name for the web app must be globally unique as it forms part of the FQDN. You will be prompted to change it if it already exists.

```
az webapp create --name <unique_app_name> --resource-group Azure101PaaS --plan quickStartPlan
```

* Open your web browser and navigate to http://<unique_app_name>.azurewebsites.net. You should see a ‘placeholder’ web page – this indicates that the web app is running and ready to be configured.

![](https://ukpducim.github.io/images/Az101-WebAppPlaceholder.jpg)

**6. Create the Git deployment access point:**

```
az webapp deployment source config-local-git --name <app_name> --resource-group Azure101PaaS --query url --output tsv
```

The above command outputs the https endpoint similar to below.  Save it for use later:

```
https://<username>@<appname>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<appname>.git
```

Note also the _scm_ section of the URL - this is the Kudu address. We’ll come back to that later.

**7. Add a Git remote called _Azure_ and then push to the Web App:**

```
git remote add azure <URI from previous step>
```

* Push the local html repo up to the azure remote

```
git push azure master
```

* Refresh the web page and see if it has been changed.

**8. Change the HTML and push again to the Web App:**

* Edit the index.html to change the Twitter account to your own
* Push the changes up to the azure remote

```
git push azure master
```

* Refresh the web page and see if it has been changed

### Web App Ecosystem

* Browse the blade in the portal, checking out deployment slots, scale up and out, App Service Editor and Application Insights

* Click on your website link. Access Kudu by inserting scm before azurewebsites.net, i.e. https://<website>.scm.azurewebsites.net/.




Option 2: Using FTP to push files to Web App
--------------------------------------------

The diagram below gives an overview of what we are doing with a set of HTML
files hosted on GitHub and pushing those into a Web App in Azure using FTP.

![](https://ukpducim.github.io/images/Az101-WebApp-FTP.jpg)

1.	Use git clone to download the sample static HTML site from GitHub to your laptop.
2.	Login to Azure and create a deployment user.
3.	Create the Azure101PaaS resource group.
4.	Create the free tier app service plan.
5.	Create a web app within the app service plan.
6.	Upload HTML files to the web app using FTP.

### Detailed Instructions

For the Git commands, most users will use the Git Bash application.  However, those with the Linux subsystem installed on Windows 10 can run the git commands from there. For the Azure CLI 2.0 commands, students can use either the Azure Cloud Shell (>_) shown at the top of the Azure Portal, or the Linux subsystem for Windows 10 with the AZ CLI 2.0 installed.

**1. Clone the html files from GitHub to your local machine:**

* Open Git Bash and run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/richeney/azure101-webapp-html
cd azure101-webapp-html
git init
ls -Al
pwd
```

* The above commands copy the HTML files locally, change to that directory, initialise it for Git, and then finally lists the files.  The pwd command prints the working directory so that you know where they are.

* Double click the _index.html_ file in File Explorer to view the website locally.  You should see a couple of pieces of static images and text on the left, and a Twitter timeline on the right.

**2. Log in to Azure using the CLI 2.0 and create the deployment user:**

```
az login
az webapp deployment user set --user-name <id> --password <pwd>
```

* You will be prompted to make your username or password more unique if you have chosen one that is too common.

**3. Create the resource group:**

* Within CLI 2.0 create the resource group

```
az group create --name Azure101PaaS --location westeurope
```

**4. Create the app service plan:**

App Service plans provide the dedicated resource for your apps, and multiple apps can use them. The plans define the region, available instance sizes, scale count and SKU level, i.e. free, shared, basic, standard, premium.

* Create an App Service plan called quickStartPlan on the Free SKU

```
az appservice plan create --name quickStartPlan --resource-group Azure101PaaS --sku FREE
```
You should see output JSON when the above command succeeds

**5. Create the Web App:**

* The name for the web app must be globally unique as it forms part of the FQDN. You will be prompted to change it if it already exists.

```
az webapp create --name <unique_app_name> --resource-group Azure101PaaS --plan quickStartPlan
```

* Open your web browser and navigate to http://<unique_app_name>.azurewebsites.net. You should see a ‘placeholder’ web page – this indicates that the web app is running and ready to be configured.

![](https://ukpducim.github.io/images/Az101-WebAppPlaceholder.jpg)

**6. 6.	Upload HTML files to the web app using FTP:**

In order to upload files to the web app, you will need an FTP client installed locally on your machine. Filezilla (https://filezilla-project.org/) is a good choice for this.

* In the _Overview_ section of your web app, make a note of the following fields:
    _FTP / Deployment Username_
    _FTP Hostname_

* Using your FTP client, create an FTP connection to your web app using the fields above and the password you selected earlier when creating the deployment user.

* At this point, you will see a directory listing on the remote host as follows:

![](https://ukpducim.github.io/images/Az101-DirectoryListing.jpg

* Drill down into the Site directory and then wwwroot.

* Copy the HTML files you cloned earlier into this directory on the remote host.

* Refresh the web page – you should see the example site containing the Twitter feed.

**7.Change the html and push it up again:**

* Edit the index.html locally to change the Twitter account to your own.

* Re-copy the index.html file to the web app using FTP.

* Refresh the web page and see if it has been changed.

### Web App Ecosystem

* Browse the blade in the portal, checking out deployment slots, scale up and out, App Service Editor and Application Insights

* Click on your website link. Access Kudu by inserting scm before azurewebsites.net, i.e. https://<website>.scm.azurewebsites.net/.
