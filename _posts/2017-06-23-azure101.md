# Student Guide

{% include toc.html %}

Introduction
============

This Azure 101 session is intended as an introductory training for
technical learners who have had little to no experience with Azure
public cloud.

The aim is to familiarise the student with some of the most commonly
used IaaS and PaaS services in Azure, and the portal and CLI interfaces
available to drive them.

In terms of orientation, the trainer may use slides to help give an
overview of some of the other services available within Azure, and the
training will also make the student aware of some of the documentation
and training resources available to them as they continue to explore.

Pre-requisites
==============

Overview
--------

All students must complete the required pre-requisites for the training
prior to attendance, to maximise the time and value of the session
itself.

There is a companion document, *Azure Student Prereqs Guide*, that
provides additional guidance to meet the pre-requisites.

Requirements
------------

-   An active Microsoft Azure subscription

-   Azure CLI 2.0. Either:

    -   Cloud Shell within the Azure Portal (no installation required)

    -   Windows 10 Linux Subsystem (lxss) with Azure CLI 2.0 installed
        (power users)

-   Basic Git tools

    -   Add git to lxss if installed (power users)

    -   If not, then install Git Bash

Recommended
-----------

-   A Twitter account

Optional
--------

-   JSON template editor. **One** of the following:

    -   Visual Studio Code (preferred)

    -   Visual Studio 2017

Accessing and customising the portal
====================================

Azure Resource Manager Portal
-----------------------------

The main Azure portal is <https://portal.azure.com>.

Login using the account for your Azure subscription. Your account
information is at the top right, including password change, and viewing
permissions and your bill.

Next to that is the Help + Support, for accessing the help or opening up
a support ticket. Click on the Help + Support icon and then

-   launch the guided tour

-   see what’s new

-   check the keyboard shortcuts

The cog icon is the Portal Settings. You can filter when you have
multiple subscriptions, change the language and certain portal
characteristics.

-   Change the theme

Next to the Azure Cloud Shell is the Notifications section, for status
updates, billing updates and to show deployment activity.

Dashboard Customisation
-----------------------

The Azure portal enables you to have multiple dashboards and to
customise those dashboards. You can also share dashboards with other AAD
users or groups within the subscription, leveraging the role based
access control (RBAC) to control who has access.

-   Create a new dashboard, and name it Azure 101

-   From the Tile Gallery’s General area, pull across

    -   All Resources Reconfigure (using the ellipsis (…)) to change to
        4x4 tiles

    -   Clock Reconfigure to 2x1, 24 hour, and London time

    -   Quickstart Tutorials

    -   Markdown Change title to Azure 101, subtitle to Useful Links,
        and replace the Content with the markdown below and then resize
        to fit

-   [Architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/index#pivot=architecture)

-   [Learning
    Paths](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/learning-paths)

Create a resource group called Azure101IaaS
===========================================

-   Open the Azure [portal](http://portal.azure.com)

-   Either

    -   Click on the + New icon (or G+N), search for “Resource Group”
        and click on it

    -   Click on Resource Groups in your favourites and click on Add

    -   Click on the More Services &gt; icon, Resource Groups in the
        General section and then on Add

-   Create with

    -   Resource Group Name Azure101IaaS

    -   Resource Group Location West Europe

-   Note deployment notification area

-   Refresh the resource groups and click on the Azure101IaaS resource
    group

Create a vNet with two subnets
==============================

-   Add a Virtual Network

    -   Click on the +

    -   Search on “Virtual Network”

    -   Select, then Create

-   Name: azure101vNet

-   Address space: 10.4.0.0/16

-   Subnet name: webSubnet

-   Subnet address range: 10.4.1.0/24

Once created, click into it and add the second subnet:

-   Select subnets on the blade

-   Add dbSubnet (10.4.2.0/24)

Search on information in the portal and on the Azure docs area for:

-   Network Security Groups (NSGs)

-   GatewaySubnet

-   ExpressRoute and Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN Gateways

-   Network Virtual Appliances

-   User Defined Routes (UDRs) in Route Tables

-   vNet Peering

-   Region to region S2S VPNs

Windows virtual machine
=======================

Go to the Azure Docs area, and click on Windows Virtual Machines in the
Deploy Infrastructure section of the Get Started tab. Choose a five
minute quickstart, either portal, PowerShell or CLI.

Create the VM
-------------

-   Add a Windows Server 2016 Datacenter server

-   Name: myWindowsVM

-   VM disk type: SSD

-   Resource Group: Existing Azure101IaaS resource group

-   Location: West Europe

-   Size: DS1\_v2

-   Use Managed Disks: Yes

Understand

-   Azure Hybrid Use Benefit

-   Benefits of Managed Disks vs manual Storage Accounts

HTTP Web Server
---------------

-   Add IIS via a terminal services session

-   Open port 80/tcp inbound on the NSG

-   Test access via a browser

-   Stop the VM to deallocate resource

Understand

-   Additional VM tutorials available - disks, DSC, images, scale sets,
    load balancing, backup, monitoring, policies, etc.

-   Deallocation vs shutdown in the Remote Desktop console

Linux virtual machine
=====================

Create your SSH keypair
-----------------------

Run the following commands in your Bash shell:

cd \~

umask 033

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "richard.cheney@microsoft.com"

ls -Al .ssh

cat .ssh/id\_rsa.pub

The -C is a comment. It is good etiquette to add in your email address
so that any key owners are easily identified. You will be prompted for a
filename. You can specify an alternative name, or hit enter to use the
defaults (recommended). For the passphrase, it is best practice to
provide a passphrase with a few memorable but disassociated words.
However, for the sake of this exercise you may simply press enter for an
empty passphrase, and then you won’t be challenged for it later when
using ssh to connect toi the Linux VM.

Copy the contents of the id\_rsa.pub file to the clipboard as you will
use this later.

Create a VM template
--------------------

Do the following from the portal

-   Add an Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS server

-   Name: myLinuxVM

-   VM disk type: HDD

-   SSH Public Key: Copy and pasted from cat \~/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub

-   Resource Group: Existing Azure101IaaS resource group

-   Location: West Europe

-   Size: D1\_v2

-   Subnet: dbSubnet

-   High Availability Set: Create myLinuxAS

*Do not* click on Create straight away. Let’s explore templates a
little.

-   Click instead on Download template and parameters. Browse the
    template JSON, the parameters JSON, and the scripts to deploy the
    template from PowerShell and CLI 2.0.

-   Click on Create to submit the job.

-   Browse to Services tab on Azure Docs, and then find the Azure
    Resource Manager tile in the Monitoring + Management area. Discover
    the [export
    template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-export-template)
    functionality, as well as the JSON [template
    structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates).

-   Click on Add within the Azure101IaaS Resource Group, and fine
    Template Deployment.

-   Search in the Load a GitHub quickstart template, type “load” and
    select one of the community templates and accompanying parameters
    file.

-   Search the Azure Quickstart Templates GitHub repo to find the same
    template.

Use the Bash shell to open a secure shell session

-   SSH to the VM’s public IP address: ssh &lt;adminuser&gt;@&lt;public
    IP address&gt;

WebApps
=======

Overview
--------

The PaaS workshop will touch on both Web Apps and Logic Apps. The
diagram below gives an overview of what we are doing with a set of html
files hosted on GitHub and pushing those into a Web App in Azure.

> ![](media/image2.jpg){width="6.5in" height="5.084027777777778in"}

1.  Use git clone to download the sample static HTML site from GitHub to
    your laptop.

2.  Login to Azure and create a deployment user.

3.  Create the Azure101PaaS resource group.

4.  Create the free tier app service plan.

5.  Create a web app within the app service plan.

6.  Upload HTML files to the web app using FTP.

Instructions
------------

This section will use a combination of interfaces, using the portal, git
commands and CLI 2.0 commands, and so the document uses colour coding to
denote these:

> Azure Portal
>
> CLI 2.0
>
> Git

For CLI 2.0, most users will be using the Cloud Shell (**&gt;\_**) shown
at the top of the Azure Portal. The Cloud Shell provides a convenient
way to use CLI 2.0 without having to install it locally.

For the Git commands, use the Git Bash application.

Clone the html files from GitHub to your local machine
------------------------------------------------------

-   Open Git Bash on your **local machine** and run:

git clone <https://github.com/richeney/azure101-webapp-html>

cd azure101-webapp-html

ls -Al

pwd

-   The commands copy the html files locally, changes to that directory
    and then lists the files. The pwd command prints the working
    directory so that you know where they are.

-   Double click the index.html file in File Explorer to view the
    website locally. You should see a couple of pieces of static images
    and text on the left, and a Twitter timeline on the right.

1.  Login in to Azure via CLI 2.0 and create the deployment user
    ------------------------------------------------------------

    In this section, we will create a deployment username and password –
    this will be used when connecting to our web app via FTP in order to
    upload the HTML files.

-   Login to Azure via CLI 2.0, following the instructions displayed

az login

**Note** that if using the Azure Cloud Shell, you are automatically
logged in and therefore the above command is not required.

-   Create the deployment user:

az webapp deployment user set --user-name *&lt;id&gt;* --password
*&lt;pwd&gt;*

-   You will be prompted to make you username or password more unique if
    you have chosen one that is too common

Create the resource group
-------------------------

> Within CLI 2.0 create the resource group

az group create --name Azure101IaaS --location westeurope

Create the App Service plan
---------------------------

> The App Service plans provide the dedicated resource for your apps,
> and multiple apps can use them. The plans define the region, available
> instance sizes, scale count and SKU level, i.e. free, shared, basic,
> standard, premium.

-   Create an App Service plan called quickStartPlan on the Free SKU

az appservice plan create --name quickStartPlan --resource-group
Azure101IaaS --sku FREE

-   You should see output JSON when the command succeeds

Create the Web App
------------------

-   Create the web app. The name for the web app must be globally unique
    as it forms part of the FQDN. You will be prompted to change it if
    it already exists.

az webapp create --name *&lt;unique\_app\_name&gt;* --resource-group
Azure101IaaS --plan quickStartPlan

-   Again, there will be output JSON once the command succeeds

-   Open your web browser and navigate to
    http://&lt;unique\_app\_name&gt;.azurewebsites.net

    a.  ![](media/image3.png){width="3.0378783902012247in"
        height="2.3332600612423446in"}

<!-- -->

-   You will now see a ‘placeholder’ web page – this indicates that the
    web app is running and ready to be configured.

1.  Upload HTML files to the web app using FTP
    ------------------------------------------

    In order to upload files to the web app, you will need an FTP client
    installed locally on your machine. Filezilla
    (<https://filezilla-project.org/>) is a good choice for this.

-   In the *Overview* section of your web app, make a note of the
    following fields:

    -   *FTP / Deployment Username*

    -   *FTP Hostname*

-   Create an FTP connection to your web app using the fields above and
    the password you selected earlier when creating the deployment user.

-   At this point, you will see a directory listing on the remote host
    as follows:

    ![](media/image4.png){width="0.9791666666666666in"
    height="1.0729166666666667in"}

-   Drill down into the *Site* directory and then *wwwroot*.

-   Copy the HTML files you cloned earlier into this directory on the
    remote host.

<!-- -->

-   Refresh the web page – you should see the example site containing
    the Twitter feed.

Change the html and push it up again
------------------------------------

-   Edit the index.html locally to change the Twitter account to your
    own

-   Re-copy the index.html file to the web app using FTP.

-   Refresh the web page and see if it has been changed

WebApp Ecosystem
----------------

-   Browse the blade in the portal, checking out deployment slots, scale
    up and out, App Service Editor and Application Insights

-   Click on your website link. Access Kudu by inserting scm before
    azurewebsites.net, i.e. . More and more functionality is now
    surfaced in the portal, but there is still some more flexibility
    here.

Logic Apps
==========

In this section we will use logic apps to poll for tweets from the
presenter, and automatically send that content out from your own Twitter
account.

-   In the Azure101PaaS resource group, click Add and find Logic Apps

-   Create a new Logic App in West Europe

-   Click into it and select Twitter for the new tweet trigger

    -   Sign in to Twitter

    -   Search on tweets from @RichCheneyAzure with the hashtag
        \#azure101

    -   Set frequency to every two minutes

-   Add a condition for the username to be RichCheneyAzure

-   Click on new action, search on tweet and pick Post a Tweet, and in
    the Tweet Text dialog box select Tweet Text

-   The trainer will take a photo and tweet using the \#azure101 hashtag

-   The trigger history should eventually show a status other than
    skipped

-   Refreshing your webpage should show the updated twitter feed
