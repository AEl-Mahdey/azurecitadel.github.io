This is a hands on lab / learning exercise walking through DevOps in Azure with ASP.NET Core, Docker & VSTS

### Synopsis 
From first principals and nothing but VS Code, an empty directory and a command terminal we will create a working web application running in Azure, in Linux containers, deployed via an automated DevOps CI/CD pipeline

The scenario will cover:
- .NET Core (ASP MVC webapp)
- Docker & Docker Machine
- Azure
- VSTS

You do not need to be an .NET expert for the coding part but you will need to make basic changes to a C# file, and some HTML. Likewise no prior experience with VSTS and Azure is required (but obviously beneficial). We will also spend some time with the Docker & docker-machine command line tools, but all commands will be supplied. You will be able to complete the lab with either a Windows or Mac machine, but only Windows has been tested.
