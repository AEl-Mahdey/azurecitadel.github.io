## Azure Pathfinder

Very often we find that customers have a desire to move to the cloud, however with the amount of services available to them and the mind shift in how we look at workloads in the cloud, for example, do I stick with hosting workloads in VMs in an IaaS model or do I move to "Cloud Native" architectures and PaaS and SaaS solutions. All these decisions can place road blocks in the way of moving customers infrastructure to a cloud platform like Azure. Microsoft has attempted to address this with the development of the Azure Pathfinder tool.

With this tool you will be able to guide your customers through an assesement process with questianires regarding their current workloads and provide a detailed report regarding the Azure recomendations for hosting those workloads in the Azure cloud. Please check out the link below and look to see how this can benefit your customers
