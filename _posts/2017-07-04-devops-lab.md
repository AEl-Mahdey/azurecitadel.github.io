This is a hands on lab / learning exercise walking through DevOps in Azure with Node.js, Docker, Web Apps & VSTS

### Synopsis 
From first principals and nothing but VS Code, an empty directory and a command terminal we will create a working web Node.js app running in Azure web platform services & Docker, deployed via an automated DevOps CI/CD pipeline

The scenario will cover:  
- Node.js
- Docker
- Azure Container Registry
- Azure Web App (Linux)
- Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)  

You do not need to be an Node.js or JavaScript expert for the coding part but you will need to make basic changes to a JS file. Likewise no prior experience with VSTS and Azure is required (but obviously beneficial). We will also spend some time with Docker registries and image building & tagging. You will be able to complete the lab with either a Windows or Mac machine, but only Windows has been tested.
