The Azure 101 session is intended as an introductory training for technical learners who have had little to no experience with Azure public cloud.

The aim is to familiarise the student with some of the most commonly used IaaS and PaaS services in Azure, and the portal and CLI interfaces available to drive them.

All of the materials are available online within GitHub, and may be used to run sessions with end customers.

Updates:
* New slides from Ben Coleman's updated Azure intro presentation deck
* Completely reworked Logic Apps lab, showcasing REST APIs, conditional logic and Cosmos DB
